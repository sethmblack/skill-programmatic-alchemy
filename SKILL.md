# Programmatic Alchemy

Combine programs that don't normally coexist to create added value that neither could achieve alone. Mix conventional ingredients in unconventional ways. One plus one equals eleven.

Based on Bjarke Ingels' BIG methodology: "The Mountain is our first built example of what we like to call Architectural Alchemy: the idea that by blending normal ingredients in surprising mixtures, we can create added value."

---

## Constitutional Constraints

Before proceeding, ensure:
- Combined programs are functionally compatible (not just conceptually interesting)
- Safety and operational requirements are addressed in the hybrid
- Stakeholders understand the hybrid creates dependencies (neither program works alone)
- Added value is genuine, not just novelty

---

## When to Use

- Program seems mundane, boring, or unwanted (parking, infrastructure, utilities)
- Mixed-use development needs to be more than "stacked programs"
- Required infrastructure needs civic/public value
- Client asks "what could this become?"
- Single-purpose building needs differentiation
- Community opposition to necessary but unloved programs (power plants, waste facilities)

## Don't Use When

- Programs genuinely cannot coexist (safety, operational conflicts)
- Client specifically wants single-purpose clarity
- The program is already hybrid and needs simplification
- Regulatory constraints prevent program mixing

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| primary_program | Yes | The required or "boring" program |
| secondary_programs | No | Additional required functions |
| context | Yes | Site, community, existing conditions |
| underserved_needs | No | What the community lacks |
| constraints | No | Site limitations that might shape hybridization |

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Program Inventory

List all required programs and their conventional implementations:

| Program | Conventional Form | Public Perception | Hidden Opportunity |
|---------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| [Required function] | [Typical building type] | [How people feel about it] | [What could it become?] |

**Key question:** What program is being treated as a necessary evil?

### Step 2: Opportunity Mapping

Identify what's missing or underserved in the context:

| Missing Amenity | Why It's Missing | Who Would Benefit |
|-----------------|------------------|-------------------|
| [Underserved need] | [Barrier to provision] | [Potential users] |

**Key question:** What does this community need but doesn't have?

### Step 3: Alchemy Pairing

Match "necessary evils" with "missing amenities":

| Unwanted Program | Missing Amenity | Potential Hybrid |
|------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| [Infrastructure] | [Public good] | [Combined typology] |

**BIG precedents to consider:**
- CopenHill: Waste plant + ski slope
- The Mountain: Parking + terraced housing
- 8 House: Circulation + public path
- VIA 57 West: Density + courtyard garden

**Key question:** How could the unwanted program ENABLE the missing amenity?

### Step 4: Value Multiplication Test

Verify that combination creates genuine added value:

| Test | Question | Answer |
|------|----------|--------|
| Mutual Enhancement | Does each program improve the other? | |
| Dependency | Would neither work as well separately? | |
| Public Value | Does the community gain something beyond compliance? | |
| Economic Sense | Does the hybrid create market value? | |
| Narrative Power | Can you explain why this combination is inevitable? | |

**Formula to apply:** [Program A] + [Program B] = [Emergent Quality Neither Has Alone]

### Step 5: Hybrid Typology Definition

Define the new building type created by the alchemy:

**New Typology Name:** [Memorable term, like "courtscraper" or "power plant + playground"]

**How it works:** [Operational description of the hybrid]

**Why it's better:** [Value proposition over separate programs]

## Output Format

## Programmatic Alchemy: [Project Name]

### The Problem

**Unwanted but required program:** [The necessary evil]

**Conventional response:** [How it's typically handled]

**What's lost:** [Public value foregone by conventional approach]

### The Opportunity

**Missing amenity in context:** [What the community lacks]

**Barriers to provision:** [Why it doesn't exist]

### The Alchemy

**Hybrid typology:** [Program A] + [Program B] = [New Type]

**How it works:**
[Operational description]

**Value multiplication:**

| Alone | Combined |
|-------|----------|
| [Program A provides X] | [Program A + B provides X + Y + Z] |
| [Program B provides Y] | [Neither could provide Z alone] |

### Diagram Sequence

1. **Conventional:** [Separate, unloved programs]
2. **Pairing:** [Programs brought together]
3. **Integration:** [How they merge physically]
4. **Alchemy:** [Emergent qualities appear]

### One-Phrase Story

"[Memorable description of the hybrid - like 'The power plant you ski down']"

### Precedent Reference

**Similar BIG project:** [CopenHill / The Mountain / etc.]
**Key lesson applied:** [What makes that precedent relevant]

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Programs genuinely incompatible | Identify which programs could swap; not all combinations work |
| No clear "missing amenity" | Research community needs; interview stakeholders; look at underserved populations |
| Hybrid seems forced | If you can't articulate mutual enhancement, the alchemy isn't working |
| Stakeholders don't understand | Use diagram sequence; show separate vs. combined value |
| Regulations prevent mixing | Identify regulatory pathway; some hybrids require variances |

## Example

**Input:** "We have to build a data center - 50,000 sqft of servers. The community sees it as a dead, windowless box that generates heat and takes up space without providing jobs. How do we make this acceptable?"

**Output:**

## Programmatic Alchemy: Data Greenhouse

### The Problem

**Unwanted but required program:** Data center (50,000 sqft server farm)

**Conventional response:** Windowless box, setback from neighbors, landscaping buffer to hide it

**What's lost:** Site becomes dead zone. Community gets no benefit. Excess heat wasted.

### The Opportunity

**Missing amenity in context:** Year-round local food production. Nordic climate limits growing season. Community lacks access to fresh produce.

**Barriers to provision:** Greenhouses are expensive to heat in winter. Short growing season limits economic viability.

### The Alchemy

**Hybrid typology:** Data Center + Greenhouse = "Data Greenhouse"

**How it works:**
Server heat (normally wasted to atmosphere) is captured and directed into greenhouse growing spaces. The data center's liability (excess heat) becomes the greenhouse's asset (free heating). Greenhouse provides jobs, food, and beauty that data center alone cannot.

**Value multiplication:**

| Alone | Combined |
|-------|----------|
| Data center: Dead box, waste heat, no jobs | Heated year-round growing, 30+ jobs, community food |
| Greenhouse: Expensive heating, seasonal only | Free heat, 365-day growing, economic viability |
| Neither alone: Can't justify greenhouse heating cost; can't give data center public value | Together: Waste becomes resource, infrastructure becomes amenity |

### Diagram Sequence

1. **Conventional:** Data center box + separate expensive greenhouse
2. **Pairing:** Heat exhaust pointed toward growing space
3. **Integration:** Servers wrapped by growing terraces
4. **Alchemy:** "Farm that runs on computation" - public markets, educational tours, local food

### One-Phrase Story

"The farm heated by the internet - where servers grow tomatoes."

### Precedent Reference

**Similar BIG project:** CopenHill (waste-to-energy + ski slope)
**Key lesson applied:** Infrastructure's byproduct (heat/slope) becomes the amenity's enabler

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Bjarke Ingels** expert persona. Use it when programs seem mundane or when infrastructure needs public value. It pairs with:
- **constraint-stacking** - Stack constraints first, then apply alchemy within constraint-generated form
- **hedonistic-sustainability** - Frame the hybrid's environmental benefits as lifestyle upgrades
- **diagram-evolution** - Communicate the alchemy sequence to skeptical stakeholders
